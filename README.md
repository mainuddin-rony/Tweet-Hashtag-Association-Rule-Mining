# Tweet-Hashtag-Association-Rule-Mining

This project requires to download all the tweets containing hashtag "#healthy". Then we have to find out the hashtags which are used together more often than others. I have applied association rule mining. I wrote my own methods for association rules mining which follows apriori principle.

I have also implemented skyline algorithm for finding dominationg hashtag groups.
